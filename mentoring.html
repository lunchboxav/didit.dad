  <h1>Didit's Product Mentorship Program</h1>
  <p>First of all, welcome üëã. Second, thank you for your interest in joining this product mentoring session.</p>
  <p>I'm still planning this paid session and I'm aiming to start in September 2023.</p>
  <p>However, I need more insight on how can I craft this session to make it valuable for both of us. Therefore, please
    spend some time to filling out the following questionnaire. It'll help me to be better prepared for our upcoming
    interaction.</p>
  <p>Looking forward to finally meeting you!</p>

  <h2>Let me answer some questions</h2>
  <p><em>Why make it a paid session?</em></p>
  <p>I know you may ask that. Well, I have several reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I've tried running a free one, it works, but it feels like I'm giving free consultancy which I don't think it's
      fair.</li>
    <li>Making it paid will add more responsibility and accountability for both me and the mentee, which makes it a
      fairer system.</li>
    <li>I need more money to fund my cycling hobby. Not gonna sugar coat this one. üö¥üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Will I run a free one in the future?</em></p>
  <p>Maybe, but I need to come with a fair system. Something like cross funding, i.e. if a paid quota is fulfilled, then
    I'll open free sessions. But it's not a a final proposition for now.</p>
  <p><em>What will the session looks like?</em></p>
  <p>We will have friendly conversations. I will listen to your stories, try my best to answer your question and give my
    best feedback and advice to your inquiry. But on top of that, I want to build connection with you. I believe that
    only through a strong connection, a mentorship can be a fruitful one.</p>
  <p><em>How many sessions will you run?</em></p>
  <p>I'm still sizing my bandwidth, but looking for around 5 sessions each month. I need to stay fresh to be valuable
    for you.</p>
  <p><em>Will this be an online or offline session?</em></p>
  <p>If you live around South Jakarta/BSD, I can do an offline one. Foods and drinks on me. Otherwise, we still can do
    it online.</p>
