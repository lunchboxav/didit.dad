  <h1>Hello, I'm Didit</h1>
  <p>Welcome to small corner of the interweb where I put my thoughts around my work as a product manager, as well as
    some personal writing.</p>
  <p>Most part of this website is still under construction, but for now, feel free to visit my <a
      href="mentoring.html">mentoring page</a>, where I open a paid mentorship session regarding product management.</p>
  <p>Also, do check my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/kotakmakan" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/apratomo" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>, and <a href="https://adityop.medium.com"
      target="_blank">Medium page</a>. It's the easiest way for us to interact.</p>
